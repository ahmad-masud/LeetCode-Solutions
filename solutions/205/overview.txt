The Isomorphic Strings problem checks if two strings can be transformed into each other by creating a one-to-one mapping between characters. The challenge is to ensure the mapping is consistent and bidirectional, often requiring two hash maps to track forward and reverse mappings. This problem emphasizes bijective transformations and edge-case handling.
