The Single Number problem requires finding the unique element in an array where every other element appears twice. The problem can be solved using a hash map to count occurrences or by leveraging the XOR operation, which efficiently cancels out pairs of identical numbers, leaving the unique number. The XOR approach is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity, making it a favorite for algorithm enthusiasts.
