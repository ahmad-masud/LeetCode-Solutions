The Longest Common Prefix problem requires finding the longest prefix shared among an array of strings. A naive approach involves comparing characters of all strings one by one, but a more efficient method involves vertical or horizontal scanning. This problem highlights the importance of string traversal techniques and demonstrates how to optimize performance for repetitive tasks.
