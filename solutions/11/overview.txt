The Container With Most Water problem involves determining the maximum amount of water that can be contained between two vertical lines, represented as heights in an array. This problem explores two-pointer techniques, where one pointer starts at the beginning and the other at the end of the array, gradually narrowing down to maximize the area. The key insight is to move the pointer associated with the smaller height, as this could lead to a larger container. The problem teaches optimization strategies while maintaining linear time complexity.
