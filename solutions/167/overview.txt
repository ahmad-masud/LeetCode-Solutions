The Two Sum II problem builds on the classic Two Sum but leverages the fact that the input array is sorted. By using a two-pointer technique, the solution avoids the need for a hash table and achieves optimal performance. The pointers start at opposite ends of the array, and their positions are adjusted based on the sum of their values relative to the target. This problem showcases the efficiency gained from sorted data.
