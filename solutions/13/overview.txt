The Roman to Integer problem involves converting a Roman numeral string into its equivalent integer value. The challenge lies in understanding the rules for Roman numerals, particularly when smaller numerals precede larger ones to indicate subtraction. A mapping of Roman characters to their integer values is essential, along with careful handling of cases where subtraction rules apply. This problem reinforces the use of hash maps and iterative traversal for string-based computations.
