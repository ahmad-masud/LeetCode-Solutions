The Valid Palindrome problem requires determining whether a given string can be considered a palindrome after removing all non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring letter case. The challenge lies in efficiently processing the string while handling edge cases like empty strings and mixed character types. A two-pointer approach is commonly used, where pointers move inward from both ends of the string to check for equality. This problem is an excellent exercise in string manipulation and input validation.
