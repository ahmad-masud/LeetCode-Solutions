The Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a specialized tree data structure that is particularly useful for managing and querying strings. It organizes strings in a hierarchical manner where each node represents a character and paths form words. This problem requires implementing a Trie with three main operations: inserting a word, searching for a word, and checking if any word starts with a given prefix. The insert operation adds a word to the Trie, search checks if a word exists in the Trie, and startsWith verifies if any word in the Trie begins with a specific prefix. Each of these operations has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the word or prefix being processed. Tries are widely used in applications such as autocomplete systems, dictionary lookups, and prefix-based searches, making this implementation an essential building block for efficient string handling.
