The Maximum Depth of Binary Tree problem measures the depth of a binary tree, which is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root to a leaf. This problem highlights the importance of recursion in tree traversal, as both the left and right subtrees need to be explored to determine the overall depth. The problem can also be solved iteratively using a queue, but the recursive approach is more intuitive. This challenge emphasizes understanding how recursive calls stack and how base cases define the termination of the recursion.
