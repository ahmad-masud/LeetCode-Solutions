The Two Sum problem is a classic challenge where you need to identify two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target value. The problem requires an efficient approach to traverse the array, keeping track of indices and previously seen numbers to reduce redundant computations. A naive solution involves nested loops, but an optimal solution leverages hash tables to achieve constant-time lookups, making the process much faster and suitable for larger arrays. This problem is a foundational exercise in array traversal and efficient data structure usage.
